This is a extreme minimal version of VimTeX that removes nearly everything but the syntax files.
I'm not saying I hate other functionalities of VimTeX, but I have already had almost all of them.
The shipped syntax file for TeX is quite broken. VimTeX seems to get the job done better.

Also add support for plaintex, in which the original plugin seems to be lack of.
